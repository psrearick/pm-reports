I am helping a property manager update his Google Sheets workflow. I want to use Apps Script to do this.

- Read the "Docs/Process.md" file to understand what he is currently doing.
- Read the "Docs/Architecture.md" file to understand the system I want to build.
- Read the "Docs/Report Templates.md" file to see what current templates are defined. I want a templating system where these are at least somewhat flexible, using placeholders that can be filled by the script anyone in the template, not just predefined places specified in the script.

- Read the "Sample/Input/Online Payment Report.csv" to understand the incoming credits file. This will be a xlsx file.
- Read the "Sample/Input/Property Transactions.csv" to understand how he is currently recording transactions. This is in a Google Sheets document. This is restructured somewhat in the architecture document.

I want to store the code that we work in the the "Apps Script" directory.

Based on this information, suggest a plan to complete this project.
